As someone heavily involved with Elementor, I wanted to see if there would be a performance impact on my website. Don't worry, I tested it and recorded everything so you wouldn't have to. Bottom line, Essential Add-ons adds features that are not in Elementor or Elementor Pro, and there are several unique features exclusive to Essential Add-ons. Also was quite surprised by my speed testing. My expectations on the performance were different then what the tests showed. Easy buy for me. AdamWPCrafter No Brainer Purchase For Anyone Who Builds Websites... If you build websites then you have worked on WordPress. IMO, by far the best builder to work with that also has the most integrations and fewest issues is Elementor. This addon takes Elementor to that next level and is the premiere addon for the Elementor page builder universe. The developers are engaged and helpful and my understanding is the addon is constantly updated and support is good. JJMagnivis.com The best support in the planet! I was having problems with the plug-in, and those guys, mostly Patricia did an AMAZING job helping me out.\nThey did everything they could and solved my problem, my website is working 100% now thanks to them.\nI appreciate! Thanks!! Marcaf Finally….. something claiming to be free that actually is free and works. Not one of those plugins that leaves you hangin. Not everyone is building for a client. Some of us just want to build our own website and dont need the pro multisite crap that usually comes with making a free plugin usable. Thank you!! Kr34tor Great tool for web designing DIY. I have not much experience with web designing. In deed start from 0 but I find this tool enables me to do almost any page design idea that I come up with, with great ease. Jojonguyen Very Useful And Great Plugin! Really save my time to create my clients website and have beautiful pages. Faisal Amirul Great addon to elementor.\nI tried a few different ones for elementor but this is by far the best. Echoingwalls Music Great Add-on (Super Support &amp; Backed Up by Speed Tests). This tool will help our web design business. It is such a great product because elementor is excellent but this addon offers a lot more features and functions. At the moment, I use both Divi and Elementor to build my client's website and looks like this just gave an unfair advantage for my elementor tool kit. AlstonClicktug.com Amazing Addons for one of the best pagebuilder out there! Essential Addons for Elementor is really great, and the amount of addons they deliver really brings your creativity to the next level when you are working with Elementor to create your website!

They also had a couple key functionalities I needed, including conditional display. Ross Lambert @rosslambert Nested section, cross domain copy paste, live copy and site sync. Not its not a joke.\nHappy addons really is pulling it off. Expected this from the elementor team originally. There r zillions of add on which has template / blocks. Happy addons has it too. But here too unique design could be seen. All in all its a blockbuster performance to start with. Suvran Principal, Mockrell School​ I came across the amazing plugin from a WP Crafter/Adam higlight video of his fav Elementor plugins and soon after downloaded into one of my Elementor demos to play around with and very impressed Especially for a free plugin #GRATEFUL100 from #TheWebStylist Thewebstylist CMO, Kenlid Enterprise​ We are a WordPress Agency frequently getting requests for creating the pre-developed websites for specific industries and niche. Using the Elementor theme makes it very simple yet attractive. So glad to find Happy Addons and it’s an amazing set of widgets that makes the complex functions matter of clicks. We have used it for many of our websites and it’s Cross-Domain Copy/Paste feature is just awesome. Highly recommended if you are working on Elementor. The most complete Elementor addons I have ever used. I highly recommend this addon. It’s awesome, very easy to use, very well build and most importantly this is the only element add-ons you will ever need. Alphaalam HRD, Jadeson Global​ Best &amp; most user friendly addon for elementor ever created. Purchase this addon and your life is set! Great for web designers &amp; agencies.\nHighly Recommend! As a developer and designer I use Elementor to speed up my workflow. This plugin now helps me speed up my workflow even more by providing an amazing set of presets. I was sold when I read, “nested sections.\" I’ve tried and purchased several Elementor addons and Happy Addons is clearly one of the best. They seem to focus in quality instead of quantity which is my preferred way (they still have plenty of widgets, tho). In addition to exceptionally pretty design, the team is very responsive and eager to help e.g. if you need to tweak one of their widgets."

It has everything I need for customization and what would normally take 5 or 6 plugins, you can do with one. Worth it completely. Save yourself the headache of finding a bunch of plugins to do what this plugin alone can do and just get it. 50 bucks a year is impossible to beat. I’ve tried. Faithinchaos21 WordPress Participant I recently reviewed my (too) many add-on packages with various suppliers and found that a lot of the packages I was using are now redundant as Premium add-ons have included many of the features that I had subscribed for which will save me money. I also had the pleasure of an extremely helpful support team who responded quickly and diligently to my request. Five stars! <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/getting-better-and-better-11/\"></a> I found Premium Addons when searching for an icon button that would trigger a Calendly popup script. Couldn’t get it work and posted in the Support forum. Leap 13 was very responsive and helpful. Truly amazing support. I look forward trying out more of their widgets and will likely get the Pro version instead of renewing Astra. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-addons-better-support/\"></a> I’ve tried just about every pack of Elementor add-ons available and there is a lot of good competition out there. I have to say that Premium’s really are the cream of the crop – a premium quality product here, to be sure. I highly recommend these as the must-have add-on pack. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/premium-is-right/\"></a>"

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/essential-addons-for-elementor-lite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is popular, well-rated, and gets you access to 40+ new widgets, including many widgets that you’d otherwise only get in Elementor Pro like post grids, post timelines, testimonials, and more. And if you go with the <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/essential-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pro version</a>, you’ll stack on 29+ more widgets, including some unique ones that I haven’t seen elsewhere. Some of the most unique widgets here include: Post blocks (flex) Interactive promo (neat hover effects on a box) Dynamic filterable gallery Protected content (restrict content by user role or password) Data tables Lightbox/modal popups Overall, this is one of the biggest sets of Elementor widgets that you’ll find, and all of them look great. You can preview any of them by clicking from the homepage. For example, here’s that neat filterable gallery in action: Price: $39.97 for 1 website or $69.97 for unlimited sites.

By new “options”, I mean the ability to add lazy loading or AJAX pagination to your post grids, as well as lots of custom animations that you can apply to widgets. As for the new widgets in the Pro version, some of my favorites are: Responsive tabs FAQ Flat style buttons Image slider …and more Price: $37/year for use on a single site, $69/year for use on up to 5 sites, or $99/year for use on up to 25 sites.

It brands itself as “the ultimate toolkit for building websites with Elementor”. Crocoblock includes: Jet plugins – this is a suite of 20 different plugins that add new widgets and visual effects to Elementor Templates – you get access to tons of new Elementor templates (I’m not sure of the exact number, but it’s a lot) Then, you also get access to the Kava Pro theme, which is designed to pair well with Elementor (I’ve never used this, but it looks solid). Still, I think most of the value comes from the Jet plugins and templates. You can purchase the Jet plugins individually, or you can also subscribe to the all-inclusive Crocoblock membership for access to everything. Price: The price of individual Jet plugins ranges between free and $39. The all-inclusive yearly membership comes at $130 for one site and $265 for unlimited sites. There’s also a lifetime unlimited plan for $750. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/crocoblock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More info / Download</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/premium-addons-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> </a> Despite the name, <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/premium-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Premium Addons</a> actually comes in both a free and a newly-launched premium version.

It comes in both a free and a premium version. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/anywhere-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> that’s listed at WordPress.org lets you do two important things: Create global widgets that you can use in multiple places. To update all locations, you just need to edit the widget once. Insert Elementor templates anywhere on your site by using shortcodes. Yes — you can already do both of those things if you have Elementor Pro. But if you only have the free version of Elementor, Anywhere Elementor gives you those features for free. So that’s cool. The <a href=\"https://www.elementoraddons.com/anywhere-elementor-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pro version of Anywhere Elementor</a> gets more into theme building and lets you create: Single post layouts Blog page layouts Taxonomy archives Author archives Search page layout 404 page layout And it also has full support for custom fields and WooCommerce. Obviously, a lot of this functionality was made redundant by the theme building features of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://athemes.com/go/elementor-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Pro</a>. However, it’s still cheaper than purchasing Elementor Pro. In addition, Anywhere Elementor supports Pods and ACF relationship fields to display post collections. You can dynamically set the background of a section based on ACF custom fields. Price: $25 for a single site license, up to $99 for unlimited sites. There’s also a lifetime license for $249. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/anywhere-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More info / Download</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-elementor-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-elementor-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Flexible Elementor Panel</a> doesn’t add any new design functionality to the page builder but lets you customize the Elementor panel. If you decide to use some of the other Elementor add-ons on this list, it will come in super handy. Flexible Elementor Panel does exactly what it says. It gives you a ton of ways to manipulate the Elementor panel (the sidebar that contains your widget lists, settings, and more). You can: Resize the panel Collapse the panel Drag the panel anywhere Choose a dark skin if you prefer Sort widget categories Collapse widget categories (though I believe this one is now a core Elementor feature anyway). Basically, if you have both Elementor Pro and some other third-party Elementor widgets, your side panel is going to be super busy. Flexible Elementor Panel helps you organize it better so that you can find the widgets you need more quickly. And it’s 100% free. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-elementor-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More info / Download</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Unlimited Elements</a> is a popular freemium Elementor add-on that, true to the name, comes absolutely packed with new widgets to use in your designs. The free version alone has 100+ new widgets while the Pro version offers a whopping 200+ new options. Now, they’re playing a little fast and loose with the marketing company because some of these are just variations on the same theme. But even with that in mind, the point remains that you get access to a lot of new options, even in the free version. Beyond that, you also get 100+ new templates to save you time when creating designs. The widgets span all areas. For example, you’ll get both “big” content widgets as well as “small” widgets for effects or separators. Here’s a look at some of the many widget categories: Post list Hero section Flip boxes Instagram Pricing Icon boxes Bullet lists Audio player Hover effects Buttons Google Charts Social network icons Testimonials That’s not even the full list! You have a lot of options. And if those options aren’t enough, it comes with a built-in widget creator that lets you create your own widgets to use in Elementor. You’ll need a little tech knowledge for this feature as it’s based on Twig. But even still, it’s a lot simpler than building your widgets from scratch. Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://unlimited-elements.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $39 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $99 for a lifetime license. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/happy-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/happy-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Happy Addons</a> is another freemium option that helps you add a ton of new widgets to your Elementor site. It comes from WeDevs, the same team behind other popular plugins such as the Dokan WooCommerce multi-vendor marketplace. It adds a collection of 39+ new free widgets, plus dozens more in the premium version. Some of these widgets are enhancements to basic building blocks, such as a post list, gradient heading, dual button, and info/icon box. However, the free version also gives you some unique options, including the following: Calendly integration to schedule meetings Step flow Newsticker 360° rotation for images Image compare Data tables There are also a bunch of form styler widgets for popular form plugins. The premium version adds a number of new widgets, including price menus, image hotspots, Facebook feeds, and more. Beyond the widgets, you also get some other features and enhancements: 400+ new templates to use in your designs A new icon library with 500+ icons Manage column widths by adding pixels Cross-domain copy/paste Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/happy-elementor-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/happy-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $39 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $149 for a lifetime license. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/master-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/master-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Master Addons</a> is yet another freemium add-on. However, unlike some of the other add-ons, it focuses on mainly offering new features, rather than just new widgets (though it does add plenty of widgets, too). Here are some of the most notable new features that you get: Header, footer, and comment form builder (without the need for Elementor Pro) Mega menu builder that lets you use Elementor to design your own custom mega menu Custom breakpoints feature that lets you create unlimited custom breakpoints to use in your Elementor designs (this is a common criticism of Elementor, which makes this feature very valuable) More advanced display conditions that let you show/hide sections or widgets based on user role, logged-in status, operating system, time of day, and lots more Element-level custom CSS for free (you can normally only get this feature in Elementor Pro) Content restriction for widgets, sections, and columns As you can see, that’s a lot of new options to use in your Elementor designs. Beyond that, you also get 30+ new custom widgets, including table of contents, team members slider, gallery slider, animated headlines, and lots more. Overall, though, the most unique thing about this plugin is the new features that it gives you. Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/master-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $29 for a one-year license and use on a single site or just $49 for a lifetime license. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stratum</a> is an Elementor extension from popular developer MotoPress. It comes in both a free and a premium version and it focuses on offering really solid foundational widgets, rather than getting into the more unique widgets that some other tools offer. I like this approach because you’ll spend most of your time using these types of foundational elements, so you want them to be perfect. Another unique thing about the plugin is that the free version gives you access to all 20+ widgets, including some of the following: Advanced accordion and tabs Advanced post list Banner Advanced Google map Advanced slider Instagram feed There are also a few more unique widgets (still free), including: Image accordion or hotspot Vertical or horizontal timeline Lottie animations Though you get access to all of the widgets for free, the Pro version adds more features to those widgets. For example, the Pro version lets you autoplay your sliders and infinitely loop them. It also gives more map styles. You can <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum-compare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">view a full comparison of the features here</a>. Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stratum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $29 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $59 for use on unlimited sites. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elements-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elements-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elements Plus!</a> is a 100% free Elementor extension from CSSIgniter, a popular theme and plugin shop (that also makes the popular Elementorism set of <a href=\"https://athemes.com/collections/best-elementor-wordpress-themes-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elementor templates</a>). It gives you 30+ new widgets or features, including both enhancements to basic foundational widgets as well as some very unique widgets that might come in useful. In the “unique” widgets/feature column, I would share the following as examples: YouTube slideshow Scheduling feature – lets you control any widget’s visibility based on date Tooltip feature – add a tooltip to basic heading, button, or icon widgets Preloader plus – add a website preloader Image comparison widget Image hotspot widget Sticky video feature – make the default video widget sticky And on the more foundational front, you’ll get enhanced widgets for buttons, headings, Google Maps, and some form stylers. Price: 100% free and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elements-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available at WordPress.org</a>. <a href=\"https://mightythemes.com/mighty-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> Finally, we have <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/mighty-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mighty Addons</a>, a freemium tool that adds new widgets, features, and templates to Elementor. On the new feature front, you’ll get the following options: Pixabay integration so that you can search for images on Pixabay without leaving the Elementor interface — the Pro version also has an Unsplash integration Cross-domain copy and paste Wrapper link to turn any Elementor widget into a clickable link Display conditions to only show widgets or sections to certain visitors (e.g. logged-in visitors) You’ll also get templates in both themed template kits and individual block templates. Finally, you’ll get 18+ new widgets in the free version and another 14+ new widgets in the Pro version. The Pro version includes some unique widgets such as: PayPal buy button Weather widget to display current weather conditions WhatsApp chat widget OpenTable integration widget to accept restaurant bookings Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mighty-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/mighty-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $29 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $99 for a lifetime license."

All of these tools are quality options, so you’ll want to pick the plugin that has the widgets, features, and/or templates that you need, while still fitting within your budget. With that being said, I would caution you about being “too” extension happy because many of these extensions add their own scripts. So if you start using too many extensions, you could add a lot of HTTP requests to your site, which will slow down your load times (though you could use a <a href=\"https://athemes.com/collections/best-wordpress-speed-optimization-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">script management plugin</a> such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Asset CleanUp</a> or <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/perfmatters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perfmatters</a> to fix that). Overall, though, try to use as few Elementor extensions as needed to create the design that you want. And if you decide not to use an extension after testing it out, make sure to disable and delete it from your site. Still have any questions about these Elementor add-ons?
