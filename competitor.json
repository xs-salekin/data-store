Faithinchaos21 WordPress Participant I recently reviewed my (too) many add-on packages with various suppliers and found that a lot of the packages I was using are now redundant as Premium add-ons have included many of the features that I had subscribed for which will save me money. I also had the pleasure of an extremely helpful support team who responded quickly and diligently to my request. Five stars! <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/getting-better-and-better-11/\"></a> I found Premium Addons when searching for an icon button that would trigger a Calendly popup script. Couldn‚Äôt get it work and posted in the Support forum. Leap 13 was very responsive and helpful. Truly amazing support. I look forward trying out more of their widgets and will likely get the Pro version instead of renewing Astra. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-addons-better-support/\"></a> I‚Äôve tried just about every pack of Elementor add-ons available and there is a lot of good competition out there.

And if you go with the <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/essential-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pro version</a>, you‚Äôll stack on 29+ more widgets, including some unique ones that I haven‚Äôt seen elsewhere. Some of the most unique widgets here include: Post blocks (flex) Interactive promo (neat hover effects on a box) Dynamic filterable gallery Protected content (restrict content by user role or password) Data tables Lightbox/modal popups Overall, this is one of the biggest sets of Elementor widgets that you‚Äôll find, and all of them look great.

It brands itself as ‚Äúthe ultimate toolkit for building websites with Elementor‚Äù. Crocoblock includes: Jet plugins ‚Äì this is a suite of 20 different plugins that add new widgets and visual effects to Elementor Templates ‚Äì you get access to tons of new Elementor templates (I‚Äôm not sure of the exact number, but it‚Äôs a lot) Then, you also get access to the Kava Pro theme, which is designed to pair well with Elementor (I‚Äôve never used this, but it looks solid). Still, I think most of the value comes from the Jet plugins and templates. You can purchase the Jet plugins individually, or you can also subscribe to the all-inclusive Crocoblock membership for access to everything. Price: The price of individual Jet plugins ranges between free and $39. The all-inclusive yearly membership comes at $130 for one site and $265 for unlimited sites.

					"title": "11. Anywhere Elementor ‚Äì Use Elementor‚Ä¶Anywhere",
					"tag": "h2",
					"text": "<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/anywhere-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/anywhere-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anywhere Elementor</a> is an interesting plugin because it was doing a lot of stuff you now get in Elementor Pro‚Ä¶before it was in Elementor Pro. It comes in both a free and a premium version. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/anywhere-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> that‚Äôs listed at WordPress.org lets you do two important things: Create global widgets that you can use in multiple places. To update all locations, you just need to edit the widget once. Insert Elementor templates anywhere on your site by using shortcodes. Yes ‚Äî you can already do both of those things if you have Elementor Pro. But if you only have the free version of Elementor, Anywhere Elementor gives you those features for free. So that‚Äôs cool. The <a href=\"https://www.elementoraddons.com/anywhere-elementor-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pro version of Anywhere Elementor</a> gets more into theme building and lets you create: Single post layouts Blog page layouts Taxonomy archives Author archives Search page layout 404 page layout And it also has full support for custom fields and WooCommerce. Obviously, a lot of this functionality was made redundant by the theme building features of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://athemes.com/go/elementor-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Pro</a>. However, it‚Äôs still cheaper than purchasing Elementor Pro. In addition, Anywhere Elementor supports Pods and ACF relationship fields to display post collections. You can dynamically set the background of a section based on ACF custom fields. Price: $25 for a single site license, up to $99 for unlimited sites. There‚Äôs also a lifetime license for $249. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/anywhere-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More info / Download</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-elementor-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-elementor-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Flexible Elementor Panel</a> doesn‚Äôt add any new design functionality to the page builder but lets you customize the Elementor panel. If you decide to use some of the other Elementor add-ons on this list, it will come in super handy. Flexible Elementor Panel does exactly what it says. It gives you a ton of ways to manipulate the Elementor panel (the sidebar that contains your widget lists, settings, and more). You can: Resize the panel Collapse the panel Drag the panel anywhere Choose a dark skin if you prefer Sort widget categories Collapse widget categories (though I believe this one is now a core Elementor feature anyway). Basically, if you have both Elementor Pro and some other third-party Elementor widgets, your side panel is going to be super busy. Flexible Elementor Panel helps you organize it better so that you can find the widgets you need more quickly. And it‚Äôs 100% free. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-elementor-panel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More info / Download</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Unlimited Elements</a> is a popular freemium Elementor add-on that, true to the name, comes absolutely packed with new widgets to use in your designs. The free version alone has 100+ new widgets while the Pro version offers a whopping 200+ new options. Now, they‚Äôre playing a little fast and loose with the marketing company because some of these are just variations on the same theme. But even with that in mind, the point remains that you get access to a lot of new options, even in the free version. Beyond that, you also get 100+ new templates to save you time when creating designs. The widgets span all areas. For example, you‚Äôll get both ‚Äúbig‚Äù content widgets as well as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù widgets for effects or separators. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the many widget categories: Post list Hero section Flip boxes Instagram Pricing Icon boxes Bullet lists Audio player Hover effects Buttons Google Charts Social network icons Testimonials That‚Äôs not even the full list! You have a lot of options. And if those options aren‚Äôt enough, it comes with a built-in widget creator that lets you create your own widgets to use in Elementor. You‚Äôll need a little tech knowledge for this feature as it‚Äôs based on Twig. But even still, it‚Äôs a lot simpler than building your widgets from scratch. Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://unlimited-elements.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $39 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $99 for a lifetime license. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/happy-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/happy-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Happy Addons</a> is another freemium option that helps you add a ton of new widgets to your Elementor site. It comes from WeDevs, the same team behind other popular plugins such as the Dokan WooCommerce multi-vendor marketplace. It adds a collection of 39+ new free widgets, plus dozens more in the premium version. Some of these widgets are enhancements to basic building blocks, such as a post list, gradient heading, dual button, and info/icon box. However, the free version also gives you some unique options, including the following: Calendly integration to schedule meetings Step flow Newsticker 360¬∞ rotation for images Image compare Data tables There are also a bunch of form styler widgets for popular form plugins. The premium version adds a number of new widgets, including price menus, image hotspots, Facebook feeds, and more. Beyond the widgets, you also get some other features and enhancements: 400+ new templates to use in your designs A new icon library with 500+ icons Manage column widths by adding pixels Cross-domain copy/paste Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/happy-elementor-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/happy-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $39 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $149 for a lifetime license. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/master-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/master-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Master Addons</a> is yet another freemium add-on. However, unlike some of the other add-ons, it focuses on mainly offering new features, rather than just new widgets (though it does add plenty of widgets, too). Here are some of the most notable new features that you get: Header, footer, and comment form builder (without the need for Elementor Pro) Mega menu builder that lets you use Elementor to design your own custom mega menu Custom breakpoints feature that lets you create unlimited custom breakpoints to use in your Elementor designs (this is a common criticism of Elementor, which makes this feature very valuable) More advanced display conditions that let you show/hide sections or widgets based on user role, logged-in status, operating system, time of day, and lots more Element-level custom CSS for free (you can normally only get this feature in Elementor Pro) Content restriction for widgets, sections, and columns As you can see, that‚Äôs a lot of new options to use in your Elementor designs. Beyond that, you also get 30+ new custom widgets, including table of contents, team members slider, gallery slider, animated headlines, and lots more. Overall, though, the most unique thing about this plugin is the new features that it gives you. Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/master-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $29 for a one-year license and use on a single site or just $49 for a lifetime license. <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stratum</a> is an Elementor extension from popular developer MotoPress. It comes in both a free and a premium version and it focuses on offering really solid foundational widgets, rather than getting into the more unique widgets that some other tools offer. I like this approach because you‚Äôll spend most of your time using these types of foundational elements, so you want them to be perfect. Another unique thing about the plugin is that the free version gives you access to all 20+ widgets, including some of the following: Advanced accordion and tabs Advanced post list Banner Advanced Google map Advanced slider Instagram feed There are also a few more unique widgets (still free), including: Image accordion or hotspot Vertical or horizontal timeline Lottie animations Though you get access to all of the widgets for free, the Pro version adds more features to those widgets. For example, the Pro version lets you autoplay your sliders and infinitely loop them. It also gives more map styles. You can <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum-compare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">view a full comparison of the features here</a>. Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stratum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/stratum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $29 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $59 for use on unlimited sites. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elements-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elements-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elements Plus!</a> is a 100% free Elementor extension from CSSIgniter, a popular theme and plugin shop (that also makes the popular Elementorism set of <a href=\"https://athemes.com/collections/best-elementor-wordpress-themes-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elementor templates</a>). It gives you 30+ new widgets or features, including both enhancements to basic foundational widgets as well as some very unique widgets that might come in useful. In the ‚Äúunique‚Äù widgets/feature column, I would share the following as examples: YouTube slideshow Scheduling feature ‚Äì lets you control any widget‚Äôs visibility based on date Tooltip feature ‚Äì add a tooltip to basic heading, button, or icon widgets Preloader plus ‚Äì add a website preloader Image comparison widget Image hotspot widget Sticky video feature ‚Äì make the default video widget sticky And on the more foundational front, you‚Äôll get enhanced widgets for buttons, headings, Google Maps, and some form stylers. Price: 100% free and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elements-plus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available at WordPress.org</a>. <a href=\"https://mightythemes.com/mighty-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> </a> Finally, we have <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/mighty-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mighty Addons</a>, a freemium tool that adds new widgets, features, and templates to Elementor. On the new feature front, you‚Äôll get the following options: Pixabay integration so that you can search for images on Pixabay without leaving the Elementor interface ‚Äî the Pro version also has an Unsplash integration Cross-domain copy and paste Wrapper link to turn any Elementor widget into a clickable link Display conditions to only show widgets or sections to certain visitors (e.g. logged-in visitors) You‚Äôll also get templates in both themed template kits and individual block templates. Finally, you‚Äôll get 18+ new widgets in the free version and another 14+ new widgets in the Pro version. The Pro version includes some unique widgets such as: PayPal buy button Weather widget to display current weather conditions WhatsApp chat widget OpenTable integration widget to accept restaurant bookings Price: The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mighty-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free version</a> is available at WordPress.org. The <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/mighty-addons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium version</a> starts at $29 for a one-year license and use on a single site or $99 for a lifetime license."

					"tag": "h2",
					"text": "Unlike many other types of plugins, you can use more than one Elementor extension, so there‚Äôs no need to pick a single ‚Äúbest‚Äù Elementor add-on. All of these tools are quality options, so you‚Äôll want to pick the plugin that has the widgets, features, and/or templates that you need, while still fitting within your budget. With that being said, I would caution you about being ‚Äútoo‚Äù extension happy because many of these extensions add their own scripts. So if you start using too many extensions, you could add a lot of HTTP requests to your site, which will slow down your load times (though you could use a <a href=\"https://athemes.com/collections/best-wordpress-speed-optimization-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">script management plugin</a> such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Asset CleanUp</a> or <a href=\"https://athemes.com/go/perfmatters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perfmatters</a> to fix that). Overall, though, try to use as few Elementor extensions as needed to create the design that you want. And if you decide not to use an extension after testing it out, make sure to disable and delete it from your site. Still have any questions about these Elementor add-ons? Want to share an extension that you find useful but didn‚Äôt make the list? Let us know in the comments!"

No BS here, no incentivized review. This is probably the best Elementor extension I have tested so far. The templates while they're not that many, the look awesome. Their widgets are well designed and look good on the site. Honestly, you should try it for yourself if you don't believe me. The addons are very functional.\nThe support is super reactive and helpful. Thanks to you guys! Awesome plugin! Get it NOW! I previously forgo the ElementsKit plugin because I heard that it causes a lot of conflicts with Elementor. I waited and true enough, this Exclusive Addons plugin appeared on Appsumo. I grabbed it after reading many reviews that it is a very light-weight plugin and does not generate much conflicts with Elementor or WordPress. I'm currently using it with Elementor in my business for creating client websites. So far I'm happy with it as it has not given me any conflicts with either WordPress or other plugins. Get this plugin NOW while it's still available at Appsumo. Highly recommended! Legendary Support.\nHonestly had a few problems setting up the addons that I wanted to use on my site - by only fault of my own, not the product. Support was amazing at holding my hand through the process, and showing me exactly where the settings I needed are located. Would easily purchase the addons again! Excellent extension that complements basic Elementor widgets well. Very responsive and attentive team. Very interesting price / quality ratio. So happy with this purchase. I have been spending weeks working on a new site design with Elementor and Elementor Pro. I didn't feel like anything was missing except cross site copy paste. I saw this deal makes cross site copy paste possible so I went for it. I didn't really look much further than that. It turns out these add-ons are awesome. I feel like my site design is so much slicker because of this purchase. These add-ons are made to make images and text pop and look a lot less generic without distracting. With or without the cross site copy paste this is full of value for me. Cinco tacos. Super helpful and quick! Looked at the issue as soon as I asked and offered a helpful solution in minutes. I appreciate it so much! Thank you! I have spent 2 days searching for the right plugin. I found this one at the last moment after looking over other several times. It does exactly what I needed it to do. Could not be more perfect and so easily to work. Thank you for creating this plugin! I'm impressed with the broad range of Elementor addons in the Exclusive Addons package and how well they work. And I'm impressed with the support - it's instant and always helpful. I love it when a product does what it says on the tin and works well. I come to tell my experience with this plugin. Yesterday I bought it and after having paid, I could not withdraw. Excellent products, knowledgeable fast service, 100% Recommend. Perfect addition to Elementor! I have a couple of Elementor add on plugins already, but I have to say, this one is my new favorite. Beautiful and modern designs with commonly seen widgets plus some very unique ones. My personal favorite one is the demo previewer! The only issue I had so far was with the code retrieval process getting stuck, and neither the creator nor Appsumo knowing what was the issue. But I repurchased and it worked this time. Besides that, installation and license activation of the pro version of the plugin was easy and problem free! Thanks for coming to Appsumo, and hope to see continued development and updates to make an awesome plugin even more awesome üôÇ I have been using Elementor Pro for years, and I have tried plenty of different addons/themes/plugins to give it something extra. But I always end up deleting them again, as they are usually too bloated or poorly designed, or not useful. Exclusive Addons is just so simple and well made. And the ability to disable widgets that you are not using in the backend is essential! And the documentation is GREAT. Talking to their support on their page, I experienced some wonky issues on their page while looking for where to download the pro version of the plugin (Protip: check your email first). They quickly pushed a fix to their page, and they were really grateful for me notifying them. Great experience. Thanks for offering this deal. I will for sure keep it. I hope to see the ability to use dynamic fields soon though! üòâ I installed this add-on the other day on one of my client‚Äôs site and even the free version gives me so many relevant widgets compared to others! Unlike others, there are no unnecessary widgets that I would never use.\nReached out to support this morning with a question and within 10 minutes my enquiry was answered ‚Äì fantastic support from the team.\nI cannot recommend this plugin enough ‚Äì I‚Äôm going to upgrade to the pro version.\nFive stars from me."
